Connect 4 Board game.

A two player game using red or black chips dropped in place on the gameboard while attempting to be the first to reach four in a row.

 The game then asks if the player wants to play again.
 

 - Gameboard. 
   Board set up as close to the board game with a 7 x 6, player 1 has red chips, while player 2 has black chips.

 - Scoreboard.
    Resetting page sets scoreboard back to Zero (0).  As a player wins 1 point is added to the score

-  Winner.
    The red and black player chips take up one space on the board till four red or four black chips are lined up right to left,  left to right or diagonally. Once this happens the screen shows the chips with a winner and option to play again.
